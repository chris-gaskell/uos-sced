#  OVERALL AIMS OF THE WORKSHOP 

+ To become familiar with the requirements of the single-case experimental design submission on the CAP course
	+ To appreciate the linkage between practice-based evidence and single case methodology
	+ To understand the basic features of the available designs
	+ To consider ways of making single case work more accessible to your client
	+ To appreciate the potential of single case methodology


---
#  OVERALL AIMS OF THE WORKSHOP 

To review the application of single-case methodology within clinical research and practice.
To examine practical difficulties arising from the implementation of single case studies.
To provide practical experience of design and analysis of single case studies.
To provide a forum for you to discuss foreseen problems associated with  single case design and to problem solve these with you.


---
#  PROGRAMME 

First day:  SCED rationale, design and measures
Overview of uses and applications of SCED
Basic principles.
Modelling and role play of designing measures for a single case study.
How to implement - designs and measures.


---
#  Evaluating what? 

+ You need to complete a SCED of the delivery of the Unified Protocol with a service user
	+ Any SCED design is permissible – be creative – and we will teach you all the methods
	+ Submit via Unidrive and not Turnitin.
	+ There is ethical approval for this in place
	+ The patient information and consent forms are on MUSE – the appendix of the submission needs the signed consent form.


---
#  PROGRAMME 

Second day:  evaluation and interpretation
Approaches to evaluation – both visual and statistical.
Practicing analysing different types of single case  data using some SCED software
Look at the data generated and interpret it


---
#  So why use SCMs? 

Clinical research : testing clinical hypotheses and contributing to knowledge.
Practice philosophy : being a scientist practitioner.
Accountability and evaluation : the effective practitioner and auditing your work. 
Education and training : learning SCED skills for the rest of your career.


---
#  How successful has SCM been as a research tool? 

Real contribution to science.
Steady stream of single case texts published.
Many major advances in psychotherapies originally  published originally as SCM pilots (e.g. CBT and panic/psychosis)
Big acceptance of SCM within medicine
Recent trends are away from Applied Behaviour Analysis applications to more general evaluations of therapy across a wider range of clinical problems
Less sophisticated designs tend to be employed
Wider range of more appropriate statistics available and packages that support them


---
#  CLINICAL PRACTICE 	 

Accountability and evaluation
Demonstrating treatment effectiveness to a client or a clinical team or a family (e.g. enhancing "self efficacy" and client's involvement / compliance with treatment).
Training in single case methods makes more effective practitioners?
Referral on following ineffective treatment – you will really know this


---
#  Single case defined as: 

+ The repeated collection of quantifiable (numerical) data on a single clinical case , always involving repeated measurement over a baseline period
	+ Experimental manipulation through some form of introduction or withdrawal of an intervention and the changes assessed against the baseline.
	+ Characteristics intended to help the clinician rule out alternative explanations for a finding by focusing on within-subject variability and to seek to understand and explain the causes of that variation
	+ Such an approach may or may not include replicating the design over several cases to form a single-case series (CAPs not required to do this)
	+ Qualitative approaches can also be profitably applied to the single-case design. The collection of rich, detailed qualitative information throughout the course of treatment can prove useful in helping to rule out alternative hypotheses


---

---
#  Where is the focus? 

Your individual service user
You, the apprentice CAP
Why and what leads to change in this client?
Within client variability and change rather than across groups of clients

---
#  What’s the advantage of SCED? 

+ Low cost
	+ Low infrastructure
	+ Small ‘turning circle’
	+ Easily adaptable
	+ Flexible methods

---
#  Why is SCED useful? 

Perhaps the most useful contribution the single-case design can make to efficacy-effectiveness research is its ability to answer questions that are clinically relevant variants on those of evidence-based practice:
+ Does this evidence-based treatment work for this particular type of client, who differs in some way from the sample characteristics of the evidence base?

---
#  So why don’t clinicians use it? 

+ Lack of confidence
	+ Lack of knowledge
	+ The ideal described in the classic texts on the design seems a far cry from what is possible in the real world

---
#  How to engage clients 

+ Not a must do aspect of your work
	+ Have a relaxed attitude
	+ Display interest in their plight
	+ Be flexible
	+ This is an aspect of your normal practice
	+ Encourage reflectivity
	+ Keeping an eye on progress
	+ Promise feedback

---
#  SCED balances nomothetic and idiographic approaches to measurement 

![](assets/img/image2.png)

---
#  Defining feature: repeated idiographic measurement 

+ A funnel approach from nomothetic to idiographic target measures
	+ Usually single case designs rely either on direct staff/parent/carer observations OR self-monitoring using self-report diaries.
	+ Frequent measurement of idiographic outcome measures that are key to the maintenance of the clinical problem
	+ The repeated idiographic measures provide data on the variation across time in these outcome. With this information the search can begin for the causes of that variation
	+ In essence, you then ask to what extent the observed variation in the idiographic measures is consistent with change occurring?

---
#  What is a baseline? 

+ A baseline ‘A’ involves taking repeated measures of the idiographic measures before treatment occurs - so that the ‘natural course’ of the outcome is known
	+ In terms of the ideal, long and stable baselines are considered helpful – but not that common.
	+ Technically neutral baselines are a fallacy – you have contact with the service user; you are assessing them.
	+ Some disorders have inbuilt variability, so don’t expect a stable baseline

---
#  So, why is baseline stability an issue? 

+ A worsening baseline: sudden, dramatic worsening of symptoms may represent a temporary change that would dissipate regardless of any intervention
	+ An improving baseline: problematic, because any subsequent improvement during the intervention phase may have occurred whether or not the intervention was introduced

---
#  Baseline-practical issues 

+ Suitable baseline: the assessment phase
	+ Identify a small number of target variables during the assessment and then generate a brief rating scale, which the client would complete daily over time 

---
#  STABLE BASELINES 

Baseline should be stable (mean level) with low variability.
Problems arise if baselines display:
( i )	Linear trends:
(ii)	Higher order trends
(iii)	High variability
Presence of ( i ), (ii), or (iii) makes both visual or mathematical analysis more difficult.

---
#  BASELINE REQUIRMENTS  

What are the minimum requirements for a baseline?
Number of observations? 14 DAYS
Stability?  Sidman suggests collecting data until a stable baseline is achieved.  Stability is defined  5% variability around mean value.
Remember. Your baseline measures should continue throughout your intervention and be repeated at follow up.
When does the baseline start and end? In the UP, the baseline (A) would end once you have the formulation in place. Start of module 1 is start of treatment (B).  The UP formulation goes in the appendix of the piece of coursework.

---
#  Designing idiographic measures: tips  

+ Designed collaboratively
	+ In the client’s language
	+ Can be a piece of cognition, behaviour , affect or interpersonal process (or a variety of these; topographical variation)
	+ Anchored and scaled effectively – in the clients own words
	+ High frequency occurrences are best
	+ Intensity measures
	+ Frequency measures
	+ When to complete?
	+ What time period do they cover?

---
#  Consider having a control idiographic measure 

+ These are an idiographic measure, not expected to change due to the intervention
	+ If there is change in the target idiographic measures and not the control is shows the intervention working.
	+ Stability also shows its not spontaneous recovery

---
#  Modelling and role play  

+ Lets decide as a group what the client will be presenting with and in what context
	+ What the demonstration and then we can critique it
	+ Then you will get to practice in 2s – you both have a go.

---
#  Choosing nomothetic measures  

+ These are the psychometrics that are off the shelf and you use them at pre and post intervention
	+ Do them at the end of follow-up if you have that in your design
	+ Do them at the end of each phase if you are doing more than a A/B
	+ Try to match one the nomothetic measure to the presenting problem
	+ You need to use the CORE-OM at least.

---
#  Choosing a generalisation measure   

+ Whilst the intervention should influence the target of the intervention, an important issue is whether the intervention generalises to other aspects of the client’s life.
	+ These measures are good test of the external validity of your work.
	+ You take these measures (e.g. quality of life) occasionally and often in tandem with the nomothetic outcomes measures.

---
#  Treatment  

+ Involves the introduction (and/or withdrawal) of the UP so that its effect on the idiographic measures can be assessed
	+ The UP you deliver needs to be well specified
	+ Take all of this – the design and the intervention to supervision.
	+ Tape a treatment session and get your supervisor to rate your clinical competency with the CTS-R and you can report that in your method – that would add to the write up (but isn’t a must do).

---
#  CHOOSING AN APPROPRIATE DESIGN 

The choice of design determines the internal and external validity of your single-case study.
Important to be aware of what is possible in terms of a design
Ask - am I being ethical and so are reversals or withdrawals appropriate?
Important to know the methodological features before you start (see the later planning slide)

---

![](assets/img/image3.jpeg)

---
#  The A/B design(see the CBT example with an older adult in your pack) 

+ The A/B design is the most basic approach to single-case research. It involves a baseline period (termed A), during which measures are taken repeatedly, and a subsequent intervention period (termed B), during which measurement continues
	+ Improvement on simple pre-post design
	+ It is in terms of the research ideal the weakest strategy, because it leaves open so many alternative explanations for any observed improvement in symptoms
	+ Not a SCED, but a quasi-experimental design

---
#  Consider having a follow-up phase 

+ This would make it an A/B + FU design.
	+ You can compare baseline to treatment and then stability of change in a treatment versus follow-up comparison.
	+ This is a slightly stronger design.

---
#  Withdrawal designs A/B/A(see the CAT for BPD example in your pack)

#  CHANGING CRITERION DESIGN 

![](assets/img/image7.emf)

---
#  ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT DESIGN: A/B/CSee the compulsive buying example ABC in your workshop pack  

Presence/opportunity to engage in two or more treatments – you would need to have a baseline, a phase of the UP and then another treatment.
Which treatment is most effective?
Problems: Is seldom employed for psychotherapy .

---
#  THREATS TO THE VALIDITY OF YOUR SCED  

1.	History (extraneous concurrent events)
2.	Maturation (spontaneous recovery)
3.	Testing (reactivity and the mere measurement effect)
4.	Instrumentation (reliability)
5.	Multiple intervention problems (can a psychotherapy be withdrawn)?
6.	Instability

---
#  Problems with withdrawal designs  

Non-reversible treatments:
therapeutic instructions (e.g. self-control / management strategies)
CAP/client expectations/interactions;
long-acting pharmacological interventions;
altered environments;
altered staff attitudes.

#  Problems with withdrawal designs   

Ethical / clinical problems:
Prior agreement with client / staff needed,
Client consent and general ethical issues
Ethics of accountability and evaluation
Relatively brief withdrawal phase and rapid re-instatement of treatment
Problem of client's expectations and adherence to withdrawal
Treatment holidays?

#  The 8 treatment modules in the UP   

+ Borkovec and Castonguay (2006) point out, the use of mini-interventions in which circumscribed components of treatment are actively manipulated is an underused research strategy, but one that offers the opportunity to increase our knowledge of basic change mechanisms in psychological treatments.
	+ Separate out the modules on the time series graphs and test for an effect.
	+ Submit the excel sheets as part of the submission showing each module and the scores on the idiographic measures during the phases

---
#  Planning your design – what to consider; write a plan and take it to supervision  

+ The type of design
	+ The number of sessions in each phase and module
	+ How the phases will be sequenced with the modules
	+ Frequency of the idiographic measures
	+ Frequency of the nomothetic and generalisation measures
	+ Frequency, duration, place and time of sessions
	+ Baseline fidelity (be able to describe in full detail)
	+ Treatment fidelity (how to keep everything the same bar starting treatment).

#  STAGES TO SCED  

IDENTIFY QUESTION  AND HYPOTHESIS.
SELECT APPROPRIATE DESIGN AND MEASURES.
IDENTIFY MATERIALS  AND RESOURCES.
COLLECT DATA/  SUPERVISE  STUDY.
ANALYSIS.
INTERPRETATION.
COMMUNICATION.
These stages may need to be considered collectively and not in isolation.  For example. The level of communication of findings may determine the level of analysis adopted.

---
#  IDENTIFY CLINICAL QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES 

Have you a clear UP formulation in place?
Have you got the books!?
Is the treatment compatible with the therapy as described in the treatment manual?
State the hypotheses clearly!
State any therapeutic predictions clearly!

---
#  IDENTIFY MEASURES	 

What measures are required to assess therapeutic aims and goals?
Ensure measures are suitable for SCED. In practice this usually means observational measures such as time sampling and staff checklists on in-patient wards; daily diaries of symptoms, functioning, problem resolution; regular use of short psychometric questionnaires etc.
Ensure rating scales are unambiguously worded and are anchored and well described.

---
#  IDENTIFY MEASURES	 

Ensure that diaries are well laid out and well presented. Scraps of paper do not value people and are seldom completed!
Try to use a page a day to record ratings - avoid weekly sheets.
Consider using a combination of measures targeted at both symptoms and functioning .
Consider several sources of measurements: client and partner/carer, child and parent,
Consider adding a follow ups phase; A/B-FU design

---
#  MATERIALS AND RESOURCES 

Ensure measures are acceptable/appropriate for client, or staff or carer or partner.
Plan for study to fit into clinical practice: baseline collected across sessions 1-2, intervention starts session 3, 16 sessions of therapy contracted, follow ups at 6 weeks and 6 months?
Ensure adequate resources - staff properly briefed, supervisor aware of coursework (especially to them), new staff on wards are briefed.

---
#  MATERIALS AND RESOURCES 

If staff are collecting the data do they understand the design rationale and do they need any training?
Data is being recorded and stored reliably (i.e. it is being written down in a retrievable manner, it is not missing and is confidential).
If appropriate, staff should receive ongoing feedback about progress of the case (i.e. regular review meetings) and this be reported in the method.
What are the consequences of diverting resources to this project in relation to other ongoing clinical work? Is it feasible in the setting your working in?

---
#  INTERPRETATION	 

What are the main changes or effects?
How do they correspond to predictions?
Are they valid given the design?
What alternative explanations (i.e. threats to validity) are there?
Are the effects reliable or clinical significant? Are they noticeable to therapist, client or others?
Are they generalizable or clinically replicable?
If effects are clinically nonsignificant - what explanations exist?

---
#  COMMUNICATION  AND DISSEMINATION 

Share the findings with the client or the staff or both.
Thank client and staff.

---
#  What can you submit?  

+ The design of the submission needs to either be quasi-experimental or a SCED.  The design of quasi-single case experiments is A/B .
	+ It is advantageous but not necessary to have a follow-up phase (i.e. an A/B-FU design) in which the idiographic measures continue to be collected and the nomothetic measure(s) are collected at the final follow-up.
	+ CAPs are also encouraged to consider completing a true SCED in which a cross-over design is used (e.g. A/B/C where B is the UP and C is CAT) or where there is a treatment removal component (i.e. ABA, or ABAB ).
	+ All designs need to be agreed in clinical supervision, and treatment withdrawal particularly considered due to the associated ethical issues.

---
#  What goes in the results?  

+ Present the idiographic results first in the form of time series graphs for each measure that show each of the phases of the study. Days not sessions on the horizontal axis and scores on the vertical axis.
	+ A baseline median trend line should be fitted and also trend lines fitted for each phase. 
	+ Baseline phases should be assessed for trend using both visual analysis and statistical analysis (e.g. Tau).  When significant baseline trend arises, statistical analyses which adjust for baseline trend should be employed (e.g. Tau-U).  Individual study phases should also be assessed for serial dependency (autocorrelation).
	+ Present a table of means (SD) for each idiographic measure for each phase of the study.

---
#  What goes in the results?  

+ Idiographic outcome measures should be assessed for between phase change using a minimum of three nonoverlap tests (e.g. PND, PEM, PAND, NAP, IRD).  These findings should be reported in a table and interpreted using the established guidelines. 
	+ The scores on nomothetic measure(s) should be presented in a table for each time point.
	+ This table also contains reliable and clinical change analysis and also the relevant clinical and community norms on that measure.
	+ If there is a sessional nomothetic outcome measure then that should be graphed at each session.

---
#  What goes in the results?  

+ Additional or supplementary data and graphs can be appended to the report after the reference section.
	+ When statistical analyses are reported, ensure sufficient details ( t values, d.f . , means and SDs of groups, etc.) for their interpretation are provided.
+ Graphs within the body of the text should be of a high standard of presentation and clearly labelled.

---
#  What goes in the discussion?   

+ The findings should be discussed in relation to the original hypotheses.
	+ Please ensure that you relate the results obtained to the design employed.
	+ Consider the generalisability of the intervention effect.
	+ A critical review of the methods, design and analysis employed should be presented.
	+ Please comment on any relevant organisational and ethical issues surrounding this clinical study.  The clinical significance of the study should also be addressed.

---
#  What goes in the appendices?   

+ UP formulation
	+ Examples of the idiographic data collection tools (e.g. observational schedules by staff or patient daily diaries) should be placed in the appendices and care should be taken to ensure that they are anonymous.  Redact personal information.
	+ As the UP is a modularised approach, the CAP trainees should also submit an excel sheet in which the idiographic measures are clearly labelled in terms of dates of completion by the service user and the progression through the UP modules.
	+ The signed consent form

---
#  CONCLUSIONS 

SCED can be used in a wide variety of situations and these range across service users and settings.
CAPs as a scientist-practitioners – a good place to be.
Integrate the methods into your practice – don’t be anxious.
Always start with the baseline -  the design can evolve and be flexible
Remember to reme m ber your client -  your job is to help then and not manipulate variables and phases
Play around with the methodology

#  Key features of SCED analysis 

+ SCEDs are fundamentally different to group-based research
	+ Group research -&gt; averages/combined findings/overall effects
	+ SCED -&gt; raw data/stability, variability, trends/individual effects
+ Visual analysis – this is the main analysis!
	+ Plot and analyse time series data visually
	+ Statistical analysis
	+ Use statistics to confirm visual analysis
	+ Never interpret SCED statistics in isolation – viewed alongside visual plots
	+ Be aware of the limitations of statistical analysis in SCED

---
#  Visual analysis 

+ Plot each idiographic measure in a time series graph
Time points along the horizontal X axis
Severity/score on vertical Y axis
Depict phases with vertical lines intersecting the X axis
![](assets/img/image8.png)

---
#  Visual analysis 

+ Add visual aids to help with interpretation
a) Central tendency lines
b) Trend lines
c) Trend line stability bands
d) SD bands/stability lines
Draw a horizontal line at the level of the median/mean of data points in separate phases
Can extend baseline lines into other phases
Assess changes in level between phases – useful for immediate effects

---
#  Visual analysis 

+ Add visual aids to help with interpretation
a) Central tendency lines
b) Trend lines
c) Trend line stability bands
d) SD bands/stability lines
Different methods for plotting trends
+ Split-middle trend line - Draw line connecting the median of each half-phase
	+ OLS regression trend line – Line drawn based on regression equation for each phase
Determine if there are increasing or declining trends in phases

a) Central tendency lines
b) Trend lines
c) Trend line stability bands
d) SD bands/stability lines
Suggested that trend lines only represent the data if 80% of the data points fall within an envelope bands around the trend line
Assess representativeness and robustness of any trends

#  Visual analysis 

+ Add visual aids to help with interpretation
a) Central tendency lines
b) Trend lines
c) Trend line stability bands
d) SD bands/stability lines
Calculate the mean and SD of each phase and draw bands 2 SD above and below the mean. Extend the bands into the comparison phase.
Assess spread of data points within phases
Krasny-Pacini &amp; Evans (2018)
![](assets/img/image9.jpeg)

---
#  Interpreting visual plots 

+ Interested in amount of overlap between data points in each phase
	+ Less overlap = more likely to be differences between phases i.e. an effect!
	+ Smaller variability within phases – easier to detect effects
Few overlapping data points between phases = intervention has had an effect
Lots of overlap between data points in the two phases – minimal effect of intervention

#  Statistical analysisIdiographic outcomes 

+ Visual interpretation can be subjective so accompanying statistical analysis can aid interpretation
However need to be aware;
+ Can be influenced by number of time points/length of baseline
	+ Can be misleading if there is baseline trend
	+ Often difficult to compare
	+ No consensus on best statistical approach/effect size metrics
	+ Statistically significant changes may not have clinical significance
	+ Assumptions of many statistical tests are violated in time-series data (lack of independence caused by autocorrelation )

---
#  Why is autocorrelation a problem? 

+ Autocorrelation (also known as serial dependence) is the degree of similarity between one data point in a time series and a previous lagged time point i.e. how correlated are the data points
E.g. Weather is autocorrelated: the noon temperature on a Wednesday is predicted by what the noon temperature was on Tuesday, and to a lesser extent what the noon temperature was on Monday, or Sunday.
+ Time series data is often autocorrelated – a persons behaviour/thoughts/feelings are not random from day to day so the data is not strictly independent
	+ But most statistical tests are based on the assumption that data are independent
+ So when autocorrelation is present this assumption is violated and increases the risk of a Type 1 error (false positive)

---
#  SCED effect sizesMetrics for capturing between phase differences 

+ Nonparametric (overlap) and parametric (SMD, LOR etc.)
	+ Historic, more commonly reported simple overlap statistics are highly criticised (e.g., PND)
	+ More recently developed overlap effect sizes have improved (e.g. Tau)
	+ Good practice to calculate more than one overlap metric
	+ Remember they are relative to whether the desired direction of improvement is shown by an increase or decrease in the measure
		+ I.e., If desired outcome is increase , number of intervention data points that are higher than the baseline median
		+ If desired outcome is decrease , number of intervention data points that are lower than the baseline median

#  Interpreting non-overlap effect sizes  

+ Effects are provided as a proportion (or *100 to make a %)
	+ The larger the effect size, the more effective the treatment
	+ No agreed way to interpret the effect sizes
+ But Scruggs &amp; Mastropieri (1998) suggested the following interpretation;
	+ &gt; 0.90(or 90%) indicative of a very effective treatment
	+ 0.70-0.89 (or 70-89%) represent moderate effectiveness
	+ 0.50-0.69 (or 50-69%) are debatably effective
	+ &lt;0.50 (50%) are regarded as not effective

---
#  Assessing and adjusting for baseline trend using Tau/Tau-U  

+ Tau/Tau-U family of effect sizes calculates overlap even in highly variable data, corrects for trend and is robust to serial dependency/autocorrelation.
	+ If baseline phases on ideographic outcomes are stable, then Tau ( τ AvsB )  is a better index of outcome, as opposed to Tau-U ( τ( AvsB )- Atrend ).
+ Assess whether there is a significant trend in the baseline phase (Tau trend A )
	+ If there is a significant baseline trend (p&lt;.05), then an adjustment can be applied – corrects for the baseline trend for comparisons across phases
	+ Calculate the Tau effect size for the difference between phases, either based on the corrected (Tau-U τ( AvsB )- Atrend ) or uncorrected data (Tau τ AvsB ).

#  Comparing multiple phases  

+ If you have more than two phases (i.e. any design other than A/B) then do pairwise comparisons of effects for each phase where it is of interest to see if there is a difference
	+ E.g. AB-F/U design
	+ Baseline (A) vs intervention (B)
	+ Baseline (A) vs follow-up (FU)
	+ See example published papers of different designs in your pack

#  Assessing nomothetic outcomes 

+ Supplement the idiographic findings by evaluating whether pre/post phase scores on nomothetic measures meet criteria for reliable and clinical significant change (Jacobson &amp; Traux , 1991)
	+ Has the client shown reliable change (RC) -  a reduction in scores that exceeds a change that could be due to measurement error
		+ Use the reliability (Cronbach’s Alpha) of the measure and non-clinical and clinical. norms to calculate the amount of change that would be considered reliable
	+ Has the client shown clinically significant change (CSC) – moved from above to below a clinical cut-off threshold
		+ Can use defined clinical cut-off’s if available for the measure or can use clinical and non-clinical norms to calculate a threshold.
		+ Bear in mind that process or generalisation measures may not make conceptual sense to assess clinically significant change (e.g. activation or quality of life)
An Excel workbook &amp; manual is provided in the Resource Pack that will allow you to do this!

#  Evaluating nomothetic outcomes using reliable &amp; clinically significant change 

+ Nomothetic measure of general distress: CORE-OM
	+ Connell et al (2007) paper reports psychometric evaluation including;
		+ Reliability of the measures (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.91)
		+ Clinical and non-clinical norms (mean &amp; SD)
		+ Established reliable change and clinical cut-off thresholds
	+ Pre-post change &gt;= 6 shows Reliable Change
	+ Pre-post score moving from above to below 10 shows Clinically Significant Change

#  What do you need to include in your assignment? 

VISUAL ANALYSIS
+ Visual plots of every idiographic measure
	+ Include phase trend lines and baseline median line
SUMMARY DESCRIPTIVES
+ Report means &amp; SDs for each idiographic measure in each phase
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
+ Assess for baseline trend (appropriate Tau correction if trend is present)
	+ Report at least 3 non-overlap statistics
	+ Assess autocorrelation in data (instructions provided in resources)
NOMOTHETIC OUTCOMES
+ Calculate whether RC and CSC have occurred for the primary nomothetic measure (main symptom or distress measure – CORE-OM?).
	+ For the other nomothetic measures calculate RC and if relevant, calculate CSC.

#  Deciding what software to use 

+ Data input and management: Excel
	+ Lots of the analysis can be done by hand (if you want)

	+ Each has a guide to walk you through conducting and reporting the analysis in different types of software
	+ There are multiple idiographic measures – you don’t have to do all of them in the practical – the examples are provided so you have a guide for the full analysis process you will need to do for your assignment
		+ You may want to divide the measures up between your group

---
#  Feedback your findings 

+ Feedback–informal overview of findings (~5-10 mins per group)
Things to report on;
+ Visual plot of each idiographic measure
	+ Assess whether there is a baseline trend using Tau/Tau-U
	+ Calculate x3 non-overlap statistics (Tau/Tau-U counts as one!)
	+ Descriptive statistics for each phase (means and SDs)
	+ RCSI analysis of nomothetic outcomes
PowerPoint template provided to copy and paste your results into!
+ Don’t worry too much about having a detailed interpretation!
	+ This is about getting you to practice having a go so we can troubleshoot any problems now and a way of showing the different resources and what they are able to do
	+ Plus each dataset has a summary of the results so you can sense check if you have produced the same findings – just don’t cheat!

---
#  Feedback 

+ How did you find using the different SCED software?
	+ Any problems?
	+ Any questions/queries?
	+ Anything you are concerned/unsure about?
