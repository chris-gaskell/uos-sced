#  Plan for Day 2 

+ Visual analysis and interpretation
+ Statistical analysis and caveats
+ Assessing nomothetic outcomes
+ How it fits with your assignment
+ SCED analysis software and resources
+ Practical exercise: Have a go at some analysis!

---
#  Key features of SCED analysis 

+ SCEDs are fundamentally different to group-based research
	+ Group research -> averages/combined findings/overall effects
	+ SCED -> raw data/stability, variability, trends/individual effects
+ Visual analysis – this is the main analysis!
	+ Plot and analyse time series data visually
+ Statistical analysis
	+ Use statistics to confirm visual analysis
	+ Never interpret SCED statistics in isolation – viewed alongside visual plots
	+ Be aware of the limitations of statistical analysis in SCED

---
#  Visual analysis 

+ Plot each idiographic measure in a time series graph
Time points along the horizontal X axis
Severity/score on vertical Y axis
Depict phases with vertical lines intersecting the X axis

#  Interpreting visual plots 

+ Interested in amount of overlap between data points in each phase
	+ Less overlap = more likely to be differences between phases i.e. an effect!
	+ Smaller variability within phases – easier to detect effects
Few overlapping data points between phases = intervention has had an effect
Lots of overlap between data points in the two phases – minimal effect of intervention

#  Statistical analysis
## Idiographic outcomes 

+ Visual interpretation can be subjective so accompanying statistical analysis can aid interpretation
However need to be aware;
+ Can be influenced by number of time points/length of baseline
+ Can be misleading if there is baseline trend
+ Often difficult to compare
+ No consensus on best statistical approach/effect size metrics
+ Statistically significant changes may not have clinical significance
+ Assumptions of many statistical tests are violated in time-series data (lack of independence caused by autocorrelation )

---
#  Why is autocorrelation a problem? 

+ Autocorrelation (also known as serial dependence) is the degree of similarity between one data point in a time series and a previous lagged time point i.e. how correlated are the data points
E.g. Weather is autocorrelated: the noon temperature on a Wednesday is predicted by what the noon temperature was on Tuesday, and to a lesser extent what the noon temperature was on Monday, or Sunday.
+ Time series data is often autocorrelated – a persons behaviour/thoughts/feelings are not random from day to day so the data is not strictly independent
	+ But most statistical tests are based on the assumption that data are independent
+ So when autocorrelation is present this assumption is violated and increases the risk of a Type 1 error (false positive)

---
#  SCED effect sizes
## Metrics for capturing between phase differences 

+ Nonparametric (overlap) and parametric (SMD, LOR etc.)
+ Historic, more commonly reported simple overlap statistics are highly criticised (e.g., PND)
+ More recently developed overlap effect sizes have improved (e.g. Tau)
+ Good practice to calculate more than one overlap metric
+ Remember they are relative to whether the desired direction of improvement is shown by an increase or decrease in the measure
	+ I.e., If desired outcome is increase , number of intervention data points that are higher than the baseline median
	+ If desired outcome is decrease , number of intervention data points that are lower than the baseline median

#  Example: Percentage exceeding the median (PEM) 

+ Calculate median of baseline
	+ =3
	+ Count number of intervention phase datapoints that are above the median
	+ =37 out of 42
	+ Convert to a %
	+ 37/42*100 = 88.10%
PEM=88.10%
![](assets/img/image18.tiff)

---
#  Example: Percentage of all non-overlapping data (PAND) 

+ Count how many extreme datapoints would need to be removed to there is no overlap
	+ =6 (red circles)
	+ Convert to %
	+ 6/63*100=9.52%
	+ Take the inverse
	+ 100-9.52=90.48%
PAND=90.48%
![](assets/img/image19.tiff)

---
#  Interpreting non-overlap effect sizes  

+ Effects are provided as a proportion (or *100 to make a %)
+ The larger the effect size, the more effective the treatment
+ No agreed way to interpret the effect sizes
+ But Scruggs & Mastropieri (1998) suggested the following interpretation;
	+ >0.90(or 90%) indicative of a very effective treatment
	+ 0.70-0.89 (or 70-89%) represent moderate effectiveness
	+ 0.50-0.69 (or 50-69%) are debatably effective
	+ <0.50 (50%) are regarded as not effective

---
#  Assessing and adjusting for baseline trend using Tau/Tau-U  

+ Tau/Tau-U family of effect sizes calculates overlap even in highly variable data, corrects for trend and is robust to serial dependency/autocorrelation.
+ If baseline phases on ideographic outcomes are stable, then Tau ( τ AvsB )  is a better index of outcome, as opposed to Tau-U ( τ( AvsB )- Atrend ).
  + Assess whether there is a significant trend in the baseline phase (Tau trend A )
	+ If there is a significant baseline trend (p<.05), then an adjustment can be applied – corrects for the baseline trend for comparisons across phases
	+ Calculate the Tau effect size for the difference between phases, either based on the corrected (Tau-U τ( AvsB )- Atrend ) or uncorrected data (Tau τ AvsB ).

#  Comparing multiple phases  

+ If you have more than two phases (i.e. any design other than A/B) then do pairwise comparisons of effects for each phase where it is of interest to see if there is a difference
	+ E.g. AB-F/U design
	+ Baseline (A) vs intervention (B)
	+ Baseline (A) vs follow-up (FU)
	+ See example published papers of different designs in your pack

#  Assessing nomothetic outcomes 

+ Supplement the idiographic findings by evaluating whether pre/post phase scores on nomothetic measures meet criteria for reliable and clinical significant change (Jacobson & Traux , 1991)
+ Has the client shown reliable change (RC) -  a reduction in scores that exceeds a change that could be due to measurement error
	+ Use the reliability (Cronbach’s Alpha) of the measure and non-clinical and clinical. norms to calculate the amount of change that would be considered reliable
+ Has the client shown clinically significant change (CSC) – moved from above to below a clinical cut-off threshold
	+ Can use defined clinical cut-off’s if available for the measure or can use clinical and non-clinical norms to calculate a threshold.
	+ Bear in mind that process or generalisation measures may not make conceptual sense to assess clinically significant change (e.g. activation or quality of life).

.footnote[An Excel workbook & manual is provided in the Resource Pack that will allow you to do this!]

#  Evaluating nomothetic outcomes using reliable & clinically significant change 

+ Nomothetic measure of general distress: CORE-OM
	+ Connell et al (2007) paper reports psychometric evaluation including;
		+ Reliability of the measures (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.91)
		+ Clinical and non-clinical norms (mean & SD)
		+ Established reliable change and clinical cut-off thresholds
	+ Pre-post change >= 6 shows Reliable Change
	+ Pre-post score moving from above to below 10 shows Clinically Significant Change

#  What do you need to include in your assignment? 

VISUAL ANALYSIS
+ Visual plots of every idiographic measure
	+ Include phase trend lines and baseline median line
SUMMARY DESCRIPTIVES
+ Report means & SDs for each idiographic measure in each phase
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
+ Assess for baseline trend (appropriate Tau correction if trend is present)
	+ Report at least 3 non-overlap statistics
	+ Assess autocorrelation in data (instructions provided in resources)
NOMOTHETIC OUTCOMES
+ Calculate whether RC and CSC have occurred for the primary nomothetic measure (main symptom or distress measure – CORE-OM?).
	+ For the other nomothetic measures calculate RC and if relevant, calculate CSC.

---
#  Deciding what software to use 

+ Data input and management: Excel
	+ Lots of the analysis can be done by hand (if you want)
	+ More sophisticated techniques require software/web calculators (they will also do the simpler analyses/visualisation as well!)
	+ See SingleCaseSoftware table for summary of some of the available programs/web calculators for SCED analysis
		+ What you can do in each program
		+ Benefits and limitations of each program
		+ Complexity to learn
