# Assignment Guidance

---

#  What can you submit?  

+ The submission can be experimental or quasi-experimental.
  + quasi is less than three manipulations of the IV.
  + The minimum is a bi-phasic design.
+ Including a follow-up phase is clinically and academically advantageous (but not essential).
+ Designs should be agreed upon in clinical supervision, and treatment withdrawal particularly considered due to the associated ethical issues.

---
# Coursework Structure 

The word count is (4,000 words):
- Title
- Introduction
- Aims and hypotheses
- Methods
- Results
- Discussion

Not in the word count:
- References
- Appendices

---
#  Reporting standards

+ A key set of references that will help to design and report SCEDs are the:
  + <a href="https://chris-gaskell.github.io/uos-sced/papers/scribe.pdf">SCRIBE</a> guidelines.
  + <a href="https://chris-gaskell.github.io/uos-sced/papers/wwc.pdf">WhatWorksClearingHouse</a> guidelines.
+ These will help you write inclusively.
+ Read these before planning a case too!


---
#  What goes in the introduction?  

+ Concise summary of relevant background literature about the UP and how it relates to the case.
+ Consider and refer to relevant NICE guidance if available.
+ Provide focus of present case study briefly mentioning rationale and approach and end with specification of hypotheses according to design.

---
#  What to include in the method  

+ Outline of (and rationale for) design of SCED.
+ Brief and confidential description of client (presenting problem/diagnosis/previous service usage/current medication), service, supervision, and your details.
+ Describe the idiographic measures and the data collection methods
  + e.g. observational schedules, self-monitoring diaries completed by the client.
  + Analysis strategy being used (and associated software/packages).
+ List and provide evidence of the psychometric properties of nomothetic measures used
  + Analysis strategy being taken for nomothetics (e.g. RCSC).
+ A three-column treatment adherence table should be provided detailing the session number, UP module, clinical content of that session.
+ Report any competency checks done by your supervisor.
+ Treatment table (next slide)

#  What goes in the results? Ideographics  

+ Visual Analysis:
  + Time series graphs for each measure:
  + Show phases of the study.
  + Observations on the horizontal axis and scores on the vertical axis.
  + Trend lines which fit your hypotheses (e.g. trend lines, median lines).
+ Table of means + SD for the phases of each idiographic measure.
+ Statistical Analysis:
  + Baseline phases should be assessed for monotonic trend (visual & statistical analysis [e.g. Tau]).
  + When significant baseline trend of improvement arises, statistical adjustments should be made (e.g. Tau-U).
+ Individual study phases to be assessed for serial dependency (autocorrelation).
+ Between phase change using a minimum of three nonoverlap tests (e.g. PND, PEM, PAND, NAP, IRD). These findings should be reported in a table and interpreted using the established guidelines.

---

#  What goes in the results? Nomothetics  

+ The scores on nomothetic measure(s) should be presented in a table for each time point.
+ This table also contains reliable and clinical change analysis and also the relevant clinical and community norms on that measure.
+ If there is a sessional nomothetic outcome measure then that should be graphed at each session.

---
#  What goes in the results?  

+ Additional or supplementary data and graphs can be appended to the report after the reference section.
+ When statistical analyses are reported, ensure sufficient details ( t values, d.f . , means and SDs of groups, etc.) for their interpretation are provided.
+ Graphs within the body of the text should be of a high standard of presentation and clearly labelled.

---
#  What goes in the discussion?   

+ The findings should be discussed in relation to the original hypotheses.
+ Please ensure that you relate the results obtained to the design employed.
+ Consider the generalisability of the intervention effect.
+ A critical review of the methods, design and analysis employed should be presented.
+ Please comment on any relevant organisational and ethical issues surrounding this clinical study. The clinical significance of the study should also be addressed.

---
#  What goes in the appendices?   

+ UP formulation
+ Examples of the idiographic data collection tools (e.g. observational schedules by staff or patient daily diaries) should be placed in the appendices and care should be taken to ensure that they are anonymous.  Redact personal information.
+ As the UP is a modularised approach, the CAP trainees should also submit an excel sheet in which the idiographic measures are clearly labelled in terms of dates of completion by the service user and the progression through the UP modules.
+ The signed consent form
